				<p>
					MSU Women in Computing <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/msuwic/">(MSU WIC)</a> is an organization of students and faculty (both men and women) who aim to recruit, support and retain women in computing fields. 
				</p>		
				<p>
					As a member of the executive board (e-board) of MSU WIC, I have attended the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (pictured on left) for the last three years.  This conference is an amazing opportunity, and was the reason I was able to become the first MSU student to intern at Facebook as a software engineer.
				</p>
				<p>
					MSU WIC is also an active part of reaching out to local school-age girls, leading workshops (pictured on right) to teach them programming logic with Scratch, along with basic HTML and CSS.
